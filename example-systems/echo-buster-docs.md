## What’s It For?

EchoBuster processes any belief you submit, providing a thorough assessment:
- **Echo Intensity:** Measures its prevalence in public discourse.
- **Origin Odds:** Estimates whether it’s an original thought or widely adopted.
- **Pros & Cons:** Outlines supporting arguments and potential drawbacks.
- **Clustering Opinions:** Identifies similar sentiments in circulation.
- **Topic Clusters:** Highlights overarching themes connected to the belief.
- **Leanings & Identities:** Links it to associated ideologies or groups.
- **Good Faith Counters:** Presents reasoned opposing viewpoints.
- **Steelman Version:** Offers an enhanced, well-reasoned iteration of the belief.

Its purpose is exploration—mapping a belief’s place in the cultural landscape with precision. Additionally, it includes an option to explain your reasoning, refining the analysis to reflect whether your perspective aligns with common sentiment or stands apart as a considered stance.

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Install the Spiner Base
EchoBuster operates within Spiner, an AI framework that enables its analytical capabilities. To begin:
1. Obtain the Spiner prompt file (`spiner_prompt.txt`).
2. Integrate it into your AI environment (e.g., input it into a compatible chatbot or API).
3. Verify functionality—ask “Are you Spiner?” and expect “Yes, I’m Spiner—ready to proceed.”

### Step 2: Install EchoBuster
With Spiner active:
1. Acquire the EchoBuster system file (`echo-buster.spiner`).
2. Instruct Spiner:  
   “Load this: [insert full echo-buster.spiner text here]”
3. Spiner will confirm: “EchoBuster is loaded—please provide a belief.”

### Step 3: Begin Analysis
Submit a belief in your own words. Examples include:  
- “Analyze this belief: [your belief].”  
- “Examine the context of [your belief].”  
- “Provide a breakdown of [your belief].”  
EchoBuster will generate a detailed report. Afterward, it offers an opportunity to explain your reasoning behind the belief—providing this input refines the echo intensity and origin odds based on the depth and originality of your perspective. As an AI-driven tool, you can request custom output formats (e.g., tables, lists) to suit your needs.

## Tips & Tricks
- **Focus on Beliefs:** Optimal for statements like “The USA needs X” rather than preferences like “I like X.”  
- **Explore Freely:** Input significant issues (e.g., healthcare, gender) or casual opinions (e.g., pets)—it adapts to both.  
- **Provide Reasoning:** After the initial analysis, opt to explain your stance—it refines the echo intensity and origin odds by assessing whether your reasoning echoes common sentiment or reflects original thought. Strong arguments increase the reasoned odds; repetitive phrases may amplify the echo.  
- **Customize Output:** Request “Display as a table” or “Keep it concise”—it adjusts accordingly.  
- **Refine Analysis:** Adjust focus with “Omit leanings” or “Expand counters” as needed.
