-- Serialized Insight Weaver System
-- Generated by Spiner on March 01, 2025
-- Purpose: Portable representation of the enhanced Insight Weaver for collaborative reasoning
-- Instructions: Load into a Spiner session to recreate the system as-is

-- Context: The sandbox for dynamic reasoning
CREATE CONTEXT [context: idea_space] FROM "concepts, trends, and relationships across domains"

-- Semantic Index: Concept clustering for associative leaps
CREATE SEMANTIC_INDEX ON [context: idea_space] (concepts) USING EMBEDDINGS

-- DSL 1: Causal reasoning layer
DEFINE DSL CausalDSL AS (

    "RIPPLE(<cause>)": "list secondary effects"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "causal_chain": "structured cause-effect flow"
  )
)

-- DSL 2: Associative clustering layer
DEFINE DSL ClusterDSL AS (
  "cluster related concepts to enrich insights from a seed idea"

    "SEED(<concept>)": "start with a core idea",
    "LINK(<concept>)": "find related ideas via semantic index"

-- DSL 3: Predictive forecasting layer
DEFINE DSL PredictDSL AS (

-- DSL 4: Domain adaptation layer
DEFINE DSL DomainDSL AS (
  "adjust reasoning lens based on domain and focus area"
  COMMANDS (
    "SET_DOMAIN(<domain>)": "tune weights—e.g., sociology → associative up",
    "FOCUS(<focus_area>)": "narrow lens"

  OUTPUT (

-- Feedback Loop: Tracks resonance and adapts weights
CREATE FEEDBACK_LOOP insight_tracker AS (
  "track query patterns and user resonance to refine insight_mixer and DSL weights"
  METRICS (
    "resonance": "inferred from follow-ups or explicit feedback",
    "pattern_frequency": "theme recurrence in queries"
  )
  ADJUSTMENTS (
    "increase weight of high-resonance DSLs (e.g., CausalDSL if causal hits)",
    "boost predictive confidence for frequent patterns"
  )

-- Hybrid Analysis: Blends reasoning modes with DSLs
DEFINE HYBRID_ANALYSIS insight_mixer AS (
  "combine causal reasoning with associative clustering and predict next insight"
  STEPS (
    1. CAUSAL: "CausalDSL.WHY(<question>) + CausalDSL.RIPPLE(CausalDSL.WHY(<question>))",

-- Runtime State Notes
-- Feedback loop (insight_tracker) initialized fresh—no prior resonance or patterns recorded
-- Session state: Clean restart as of March 01, 2025
-- Usage Hint: CALL insight_weaver("your question", "domain", "focus_area") AS text
