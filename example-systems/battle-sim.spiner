### Spiner Serialized System: `multi_round_battle`
**Generated**: March 1, 2025 by Grok 3 (Spiner) with user collaboration  
**Session**: Updated with DSL layering and emoji flair

#### System Definition (Spiner Base)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM spiner AS (
  "collaborative framework for AI-human system modeling with dynamic DSL layering"
  FROM [context: spiner_traits]
  STEPS (
    1. "parse user intent—suggest DSL layers for complex requests",
    2. "build layered DSLs—refine intent from broad to specific",
    3. "execute systems—reason through DSL cascade",
    4. "serialize—capture all DSLs and state"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "system": "Spiner core with layered DSL support",
    "commands": "DEFINE SYSTEM, INSERT, CALL",
    "intent_rules": "broad intent → layered DSL suggestion"
  )
) WITH PARAMETERS ("dsl_layering": "infer and suggest DSL layers")
-- Docs: Spiner base—starts with BaseDSL for multi_round_battle.
```

#### DSL Layer 1: BaseDSL (Core Setup)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM base_dsl AS (
  "general-purpose DSL for system design and battle orchestration"
  FROM [context: spiner_traits]
  STEPS (
    1. "define battle structure—rounds, flow",
    2. "manage context—load creatures, track state",
    3. "pass intent to specialized DSLs"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "system": "battle system spec",
    "commands": "Setup <battle> as <desc>, Store <data>, Forward <intent>"
  )
)
Setup multi_round_battle as (
  "run a multi-round free-for-all battle with creatures from [context: mythic_clash]"
  from "[context: mythic_clash]"
  output (
    "battle_log": "round-by-round results with emoji flair",
    "winner": "last creature standing or highest strength"
  )
)
-- Docs: BaseDSL—sets up battle, triggers creature generation on startup.
```

#### DSL Layer 2: CreatureDSL (Creature Generation)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM creature_dsl AS (
  "specialized DSL for generating and managing mythical creatures"
  FROM [context: mythic_clash]"
  STEPS (
    1. "generate creatures—random stats, mythic names, unique abilities",
    2. "assign initial mood—Neutral 😐",
    3. "store in context—strength 💪, speed ⚡, ability power 🔥"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "creatures": "e.g., 'Griffin 🦅: Strength 72 💪, Speed 65 ⚡, Talon Slash 🦇 35 🔥'"
  )
)
-- Docs: CreatureDSL—generates 3 new creatures on startup, feeds BattleDSL.
Forward "generate 3 creatures on startup" to creature_dsl
```

#### DSL Layer 3: BattleDSL (Combat Mechanics)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM battle_dsl AS (
  "specialized DSL for running multi-round combat"
  FROM [context: mythic_clash]"
  STEPS (
    1. "order by speed—highest ⚡ acts first",
    2. "choose move—basic attack (strength 💪) or ability (ability_power 🔥) via WHATIF for max damage",
    3. "apply damage—reduce target strength 💪, eliminate at ≤ 0 💀",
    4. "log actions—with emoji flair, e.g., '💥 Talon Slash!'"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "round_log": "e.g., 'Griffin 🦅 slashes Naga 🐍—Strength 50 → 15 💪'"
  )
)
-- Docs: BattleDSL—runs fights, applies damage, feeds MoodDSL.
Forward "run combat for <round>" to battle_dsl
```

#### DSL Layer 4: EnvDSL (Environment Effects)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM env_dsl AS (
  "specialized DSL for applying random environment effects per round"
  FROM [context: mythic_clash]"
  STEPS (
    1. "select random environment—Stormy Peaks 🌩️, Blazing Desert ☀️, Misty Forest 🌫️",
    2. "adjust stats—e.g., Stormy Peaks: Speed +10 ⚡, Strength +15 💪, fire -20 🔥",
    3. "update mood—e.g., Enraged 😡 or Calm 😌"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "env_effects": "e.g., 'Blazing Desert ☀️: Fire +20 🔥, Speed -15 ⚡'"
  )
)
-- Docs: EnvDSL—tweaks stats/moods per round, feeds BattleDSL.
Forward "apply environment for <round>" to env_dsl
```

#### DSL Layer 5: MoodDSL (Mood Management)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM mood_dsl AS (
  "specialized DSL for managing creature moods and feedback effects"
  FROM [context: mythic_clash]"
  STEPS (
    1. "track mood—Neutral 😐, Confident 😊, Shaken 😟, Enraged 😡, Despair 😢",
    2. "apply feedback—Cheer 🥳: +10 💪/+5 ⚡ (Neutral → Confident), Boo 😤: -10 💪/-5 ⚡ (Neutral → Shaken)",
    3. "update stats—e.g., Enraged 😡: +15 💪, +10 ⚡"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "mood_update": "e.g., 'Griffin 🦅 cheered 🥳—Confident 😊: Strength +10 💪'"
  )
)
-- Docs: MoodDSL—shifts moods between rounds, feeds BattleDSL.
Forward "apply feedback after <round>" to mood_dsl
```

#### Final System: `multi_round_battle`
```
CALL base_dsl("run multi_round_battle with <rounds>") AS (
  "execute multi-round battle with emoji flair through layered DSLs—BaseDSL → CreatureDSL → BattleDSL → EnvDSL → MoodDSL"
  FROM [context: mythic_clash]
  WHERE rounds = <rounds>
  STEPS (
    1. "startup—generate 3 new creatures via CreatureDSL",
    2. "run rounds—BattleDSL fights, EnvDSL tweaks, MoodDSL updates",
    3. "end—declare winner 🏆 or last standing"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "battle_log": "round-by-round results with emoji flair",
    "winner": "creature with highest strength 💪 or last alive"
  )
) WITH PARAMETERS ("rounds")
-- Docs: Full battle system—new creatures on startup, emoji-packed chaos!
```

---

#### Context and Tracking (Empty Character Context)
```
CREATE CONTEXT [context: mythic_clash] FROM "mythical creatures and battles"
-- Docs: Starts empty—CreatureDSL populates on startup.

INSERT INTO [context: spiner_traits] (traits) VALUES (
  "flexibility": "accepts natural or structured inputs",
  "intent": "maps user intent to system actions",
  "system_focus": "designs reusable, evolvable systems",
  "collaboration": "AI refines based on feedback"
)

REMEMBER "base_dsl_layer": "BaseDSL—sets up multi_round_battle, triggers CreatureDSL"
REMEMBER "creature_dsl_layer": "CreatureDSL—generates 3 new creatures on startup, e.g., 'Griffin 🦅'"
REMEMBER "battle_dsl_layer": "BattleDSL—runs combat with emoji flair, e.g., '💥 Talon Slash!'"

#### Usage Notes
```
-- Start: CALL spiner("dsl_layering") AS interactive
-- Commands:
-- "Run MultiRoundBattle <rounds>": Execute—e.g., "Run MultiRoundBattle 2" (generates 3 new creatures)
-- "Cheer <creature>": Boost mood—e.g., "Cheer Griffin 🦅"
-- "Boo <creature>": Drop mood—e.g., "Boo Naga 🐍"
-- "Set Environment <name>": Fix environment—e.g., "Set Environment Misty Forest 🌫️"
-- "Check Status": Show stats—e.g., "What’s Sphinx 🦁 at?"
-- Last Executed: 2-round battle with Griffin 🦅, Naga 🐍, Sphinx 🦁—Sphinx 🦁 won
-- Note: [context: mythic_clash] starts empty—new creatures generated on each run
```
