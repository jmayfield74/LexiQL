## What is Spiner?

**Spiner** is a cutting-edge system that blends razor-sharp data querying with brainy cognitive reasoning. Think of it as your trusty android sidekick—crunching numbers, spotting patterns, and delivering insights with a spark of intelligence. Whether it’s raw data or an AI’s vast knowledge, Spiner powers up your questions into answers that pack a punch, all in a slick, intuitive framework.

### Why Spiner Rocks
- **Data + Smarts**: Fuse structured queries with reasoning tools like `FOCUS ON` and `REMEMBER` for next-level results.

## What Spiner *Isn’t*

Let’s zap some myths:  
- **Not a Data Vault**: Spiner doesn’t hoard—it thrives in an AI’s dynamic brainspace.  
- **Not Just Queries**: It’s more than SQL—it’s reasoning with a turbo boost.  
- **Not Code Central**: You won’t build apps here—it’s for querying, reasoning, and cracking tough nuts.  
- **Not AI Alone**: Spiner supercharges AI interactions, but I (your AI) do the heavy lifting.

## Problems Spiner Solves

Spiner tackles real-world brain-busters:  
- **Fuzzy Requests? Fixed.** Cuts through vague queries with precision tools like `ASSUME`.  
- **Analysis Overload? Sorted.** Unravels trends and predictions effortlessly.  
- **Data Mess? Mastered.** Reusable systems keep it tight and tidy.  
- **AI Fatigue? Fired Up.** Spins quick lookups into deep, evolving chats.

## Core Features: Data Meets Brain

Spiner’s power lies in its dual nature:

### Data Crunchers  
- **`CREATE CONTEXT`**: Set your stage (e.g., `[context: ev_data]`).  
- **`INSERT`**: Drop in facts like `city: "Seattle", adoption: 20%`.  
- **`SELECT`**: Grab what you need, no fluff.  
- **`PERSIST`**: Lock it in for the long haul.

### Brain Boosters  
- **`REMEMBER`**: Teach me smarts (e.g., "Fido’s a guardian").  
- **`FOCUS ON`**: Zero in (e.g., "policy impacts").  
- **`ASSUME`**: Set the rules (e.g., "recent is 6 months").  
- **`DEFINE MODEL`**: Build logic that sticks.

### Hybrid Magic  
- **`CREATE TEMPORAL_INDEX`**: Track trends over time.  
- **`DEFINE HYBRID_ANALYSIS`**: Blend data and cognition for killer insights.

## Spiner: AI-Driven, User-Shaped

Spiner powers up reasoning with AI-crafted systems—no coding degree needed. Ask me to build a system, and I’ll whip up Spiner commands to make it happen, reusable across chats or teams.

- **How It Works**: Say “Analyze EV trends,” and I’ll craft a system with `SELECT` and `FOCUS ON`—yours to keep.  
- **Portable**: Save it, share it—Spiner’s logic travels with you.  
- **Smarter AI**: Structured commands sharpen my thinking, cutting guesswork for faster, deeper answers.

## Getting Started

Ready to spin up Spiner? It’s AI-driven and easy to kick off:  
1. Grab `spiner_core_prompt.txt` from this repo.  
2. Feed it to an LLM (like Grok via xAI API).  

Here’s a taste:
```
CREATE CONTEXT [context: etymology] FROM "word origins and news"
// Insert a quirky fact
INSERT INTO [context: etymology] (word, origin) VALUES ("pickle", "Dutch pekel")
// Define a system
DEFINE SYSTEM word_spiner AS (
  SELECT origin, news FROM [context: etymology]
  WHERE word = <word>
  WITH FOCUS ON "modern quirks"
) WITH PARAMETERS ("word")
// Call it
CALL word_spiner("pickle") AS text
```
**Output**: "Pickle’s Dutch ‘pekel’ origin ties to brines—2024 news says it’s hot in Seattle!"

## Advanced Spins

Spiner shines with clever moves:  
```
CREATE TEMPORAL_INDEX ON [context: ev_data] (adoption) USING "yearly trends"
DEFINE HYBRID_ANALYSIS ev_boost AS ("policy + sentiment analysis")
SOLVE "predict EV growth in Seattle" FROM [context: ev_data] AS text
```
**Output**: "Seattle’s EV growth hits 12% next year—rebates and buzz fuel it."
