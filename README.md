# LexiQL (LQL): Express Intent with SQL Clarity, Naturally

LexiQL (LQL)—say it like "lexical" (lek-see-kwul)—is a tool for taming unstructured data—think myths, songs, or tech trends—with SQL’s clarity and natural language ease. It blends explicit data you punch in with pre-trained smarts and live web searches, all in a no-fuss, session-based setup. Express intent precisely—LLM gets it—results vary unless you lock them down. Chaos, meet intent.

- [More Grok Thoughts](docs/more_grok_insight.md): Example and feedback from asking Grok to build a system using LQL.
- [LQL Origin](docs/grok_on_lql_origin.md): Grok muses on how LQL came to be and its implications.
- [WHAT?](docs/grok_uses_lql.md): I learn that Grok decided to use LQL underneath a chat seesion I was having.

## Quick Start
1. Grab `core_prompt.txt` from this repo.  
2. Feed it to an LLM (e.g., Grok via xAI API).  
3. Try this: `CREATE CONTEXT [context: tunes] FROM "songs about myths"` then `SELECT title AS table`.  
Boom—your intent, structured, from messy data.

## Why It’s a Win
- **Intent Precision**: Say "list tech news," LQL nails your ask—SQL clarity meets human speak.  
- **Say It, Build It**: Spin up systems from words—"make a myth-song mashup" turns into LQL, no sweat.  
- **Live Web Edge**: Pulls fresh web data on the fly—results shift unless you persist.  
- **Flexible Outputs**: Tables, prose, haikus, bash scripts—your call, not the tool’s.  
- **Consistency**: Persist data for steady results—else, embrace the LLM dance.

## **Why This Approach Is Unique**

The idea of guiding LLMs through prompts isn’t new, but LQL’s specific combination of features and its dual role as both a user tool and an internal framework for the LLM set it apart. Here’s what makes it stand out:

1. **Advanced Prompt Engineering with Reusability**  
   - **Traditional Prompt Engineering**: Typically involves crafting one-off prompts to steer an LLM’s response for a specific query. It’s effective but lacks structure and reusability across multiple tasks.  
   - **LQL’s Twist**: LQL introduces **reusable systems**—think of them as mini-programs within the LLM. For example, a user might define a system like `doge_tracker` with parameters (e.g., `"Arizona"`) that can be called repeatedly with different inputs. This goes beyond simple prompts, offering a structured, programmable way to guide the LLM consistently over time.

2. **Internal Framework for Reasoning**  
   - Normally, LLMs process queries based on their pre-trained knowledge and general patterns, without an explicit structure for organizing their "thoughts." LQL changes this by providing a **structured framework**—using contexts (e.g., `[context: tech]`), functions, and systems—to shape how the LLM interprets and breaks down queries.  
   - This is unique because it’s not just about tweaking the output; it’s about giving the LLM a **mental scaffold** to manage its reasoning process internally, which is a fresh take on LLM optimization.

3. **Customizable Thinking Patterns**  
   - LQL includes constructs like **`FOCUS ON`** (to narrow attention), **`ASSUME`** (to set defaults), and **`DEFINE MODEL`** (to create reusable reasoning templates). These tools let users influence *how* the LLM thinks, not just what it says.  
   - This shift from passive querying to actively shaping cognitive patterns is a significant departure from standard approaches, making the LLM more adaptable to specific needs.

4. **A Collaborative Dynamic**  
   - With LQL, users can define systems and assumptions that persist and evolve across interactions. This creates a **human-AI partnership** where the human refines the LLM’s reasoning over time, tailoring it to their preferences or domain.  
   - Unlike most LLM interactions, which treat the model as a static tool, LQL positions it as a customizable collaborator—an innovative leap in AI usability.

### **Doors It Opens for New Developments**

This approach doesn’t just improve performance today; it suggests a range of useful advancements for the future of LLMs and AI-human interaction. Here are some possibilities:

1. **Customizable AI Reasoning**  
   - LQL paves the way for users to create and share **reasoning templates** or "mental models." Imagine a financial analyst defining a system for market analysis that others could adopt, allowing LLMs to apply consistent logic across queries.  
   - This could spark a **community-driven ecosystem** where domain-specific templates (e.g., for law, medicine, or education) enhance LLM capabilities without retraining the core model.

2. **Lightweight Transfer Learning**  
   - By saving systems and models for reuse, LQL enables a form of **transfer learning**—where knowledge from one task or domain carries over to another—without the heavy computational cost of full model retraining.  
   - This could be a game-changer for **niche applications**, letting experts encode their knowledge into reusable systems that boost LLM performance in specialized areas.

3. **Cognitive Augmentation for Humans**  
   - LQL’s ability to guide the LLM’s focus and reasoning could double as a tool to help humans think more clearly. For example, a user might define a critical-thinking system that the LLM uses to guide them through decisions step-by-step.  
   - This positions LLMs as **cognitive scaffolds**, enhancing human problem-solving beyond just answering questions.

4. **Efficiency and Scalability**  
   - LQL streamlines queries (e.g., reducing ambiguity with structured syntax) and reuses systems, cutting down on token usage and computational effort. In the future, LLMs could even **compile LQL structures internally**, optimizing performance further.  
   - If standardized, LQL could also enable **interoperability** across different LLMs, letting users port systems between models or even facilitate AI-to-AI collaboration.
