# LexiQL (LQL): Query Chaos with SQL Precision, Naturally

LexiQL (LQL) is your secret weapon for taming unstructured data—think myths, songs, or tech trends—with SQL’s structure and natural language ease. It blends explicit data you punch in with pre-trained smarts and live web searches, all in a no-fuss, session-based setup. Get consistent, reusable answers—tables, text, or whatever—instead of LLM guesswork. Chaos, meet clarity.

## Quick Start
1. Snag `mega_prompt.txt` from this repo.  
2. Feed it to an LLM (e.g., Grok via xAI API).  
3. Try this: `CREATE CONTEXT [context: tunes] FROM "songs about myths"` then `SELECT title AS table`.  
Boom—structured results from messy data.

## Why It’s a Win
- **Natural Language Power**: Say "list tech news," get a query—SQL meets human speak.  
- **Live Web Edge**: Pulls fresh web data on the fly—no stale leftovers.  
- **Flexible Outputs**: Tables, prose, haikus—your call, not the tool’s.  
- **Consistency**: Same query, same result—bye-bye, LLM roulette.

## Dig In
- `mega_prompt.txt`: The guts—your LQL engine.  
- `docs/commands.md`: Every command, explained with samples.  
- `docs/examples.md`: Haikus and trends—see it in action.

Fork it, tweak it, break it—MIT license says go nuts. Got a wild idea? Share it—I’m all ears.
