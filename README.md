# LexiQL (LQL): Express Intent with SQL Clarity, Naturally

LexiQL (LQL)—say it like "lexical" (lek-see-kwul)—is a tool for taming unstructured data—think myths, songs, or tech trends—with SQL’s clarity and natural language ease. It blends explicit data you punch in with pre-trained smarts and live web searches, all in a no-fuss, session-based setup. Express intent precisely—LLM gets it—results vary unless you lock them down. Chaos, meet intent.

## Quick Start
1. Grab `core_prompt.txt` from this repo.  
2. Feed it to an LLM (e.g., Grok via xAI API).  
3. Try this: `CREATE CONTEXT [context: tunes] FROM "songs about myths"` then `SELECT title AS table`.  
Boom—your intent, structured, from messy data.

## Why It’s a Win
- **Intent Precision**: Say "list tech news," LQL nails your ask—SQL clarity meets human speak.  
- **Say It, Build It**: Spin up systems from words—"make a myth-song mashup" turns into LQL, no sweat.  
- **Live Web Edge**: Pulls fresh web data on the fly—results shift unless you persist.  
- **Flexible Outputs**: Tables, prose, haikus, bash scripts—your call, not the tool’s.  
- **Consistency**: Persist data for steady results—else, embrace the LLM dance.
