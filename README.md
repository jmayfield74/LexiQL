# LexiQL (LQL): Structured Freedom for Unstructured Chaos
LQL blends SQL’s precision with natural language vibes—query myths, songs, tech trends with ease. Define contexts, mix explicit data with live web smarts, and shape outputs (tables, text, haikus). It’s your "bytecode" from intent to action—consistent, reusable, no schema fuss.

## Quick Start
1. Grab `mega_prompt.txt`.  
2. Toss it into your fave LLM (e.g., Grok via xAI API).  
3. Try: `CREATE CONTEXT [context: tunes] FROM "songs with mythic vibes"` then `SELECT title AS table`.

## Why It’s Cool
- Natural language to structured queries—say "make a haiku system," get it done.  
- Live web data at query time—fresh, not stale.  
- Flexible outputs—tables, prose, whatever you vibe with.
