# LexiQL (LQL): Query Chaos with SQL Precision, Naturally

LexiQL (LQL)—say it like "lexical" (lek-see-kwul)—is a tool for taming unstructured data—think myths, songs, or tech trends—with SQL’s structure and natural language ease. It blends explicit data you punch in with pre-trained smarts and live web searches, all in a no-fuss, session-based setup. Get consistent, reusable answers—tables, text, or whatever—instead of LLM guesswork. Chaos, meet clarity.

- [What Grok thinks](docs/groks_opinion.md): Feedback from Grok after having been told to use it.

## Quick Start
1. Grab `mega_prompt.txt` from this repo.  
2. Feed it to an LLM (e.g., Grok via xAI API).  
3. Try this: `CREATE CONTEXT [context: tunes] FROM "songs about myths"` then `SELECT title AS table`.  
Boom—structured results from messy data.

## Why It’s a Win
- **Natural Language Power**: Say "list tech news," get a query—SQL meets human speak.  
- **Say It, Build It**: Spin up systems from words—"make a myth-song mashup" turns into LQL, no sweat.  
- **Live Web Edge**: Pulls fresh web data on the fly—no stale leftovers.  
- **Flexible Outputs**: Tables, prose, haikus, bash scripts—your call, not the tool’s.  
- **Consistency**: Same query, same result—bye-bye, LLM roulette.
