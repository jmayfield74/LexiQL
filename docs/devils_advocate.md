# Devil’s Advocate: Why Should I Care About LexiQL (LQL)?

LexiQL (LQL) sounds clever, but let’s poke some holes...

### "Why not just use natural language with LLMs?"
Sure, LLMs are chatty, but ask "list Norse gods" twice—good luck getting the same list. LQL nails it: `SELECT name FROM [context: myths] WHERE origin = 'Norse'`—same gods, every time, no guessing.

### "Isn’t this overkill for simple queries?"
For a quick "what’s up?"—yeah, chat’s fine. But try building a haiku generator or trend tracker—LQL’s `SELECT haiku FROM [context: tunes]` scales without breaking a sweat. Simple’s overrated when you need power.

### "SQL already handles structured data—why LQL?"
SQL wants tables set in cement—myths or news don’t fit. LQL’s `CREATE CONTEXT [context: myths] FROM "world legends"` grabs live data, no schema hassle—SQL can’t touch that.

### "Why not NoSQL or GraphQL?"
NoSQL’s a free-for-all—good luck querying "tricksters" across myths. GraphQL needs a blueprint—LQL’s "just say it" beats that setup grind. It’s leaner, meaner, web-ready.

### "This feels niche—who’s it for?"
Devs wrestling chaos, analysts craving structure, hobbyists chasing whimsy—LQL’s for anyone who’s cursed LLM drift or SQL’s stiffness. Niche? Maybe. Handy? You bet.

### "Can’t LLMs evolve past this?"
Maybe someday—until then, LQL’s your bytecode fix. "Make a song-myth list" → `SELECT title FROM [context: tunes]`—no prompt roulette, just results.

### "Too complex for non-coders?"
Nah—say "list tech news," get `SELECT title FROM [context: tech]`—LQL’s natural enough to learn fast, powerful enough to stick.

### "What’s the catch—too good to be true?"
It’s a prompt, not a platform—needs an LLM to run. But that’s the beauty: no heavy install, just copy-paste and query.

LQL’s not perfect—it’s just better than the mess out there. Still skeptical? Fork it, break it, prove me wrong: [README](../README.md)
