# LexiQL (LQL) Summary

## What Is LexiQL?

LexiQL (LQL)—say "lexical" (lek-see-kwul)—is a query language that fuses SQL’s clarity with natural language’s ease, tackling the wild mess of unstructured data—think myths, songs, or tech trends—without rigid schemas. It blends explicit data you define with pre-trained knowledge and live web searches, all in a session-based, no-setup sandbox. LQL’s strength? Precision in capturing your intent—say "list tech news," and the LLM gets it sharp—delivering answers as tables, text, or whatever you fancy. Results stay fluid unless you lock them down, turning chaos into your tool.

## The Problem Space

Unstructured data’s a beast—SQL demands prebuilt tables, leaving myths or news stranded. LLM chats bend but break—ask "list tech trends" twice, and answers flip-flop, no control, no repeat, no structure. You’re torn: precision needs rules, creativity needs freedom, and neither nails your intent nor taps the web’s pulse. Raw prompts lack staying power—say "build a system," and it’s a one-off, not a foundation. Intent gets lost, and chaos reigns.

## How LexiQL Solves It

LQL’s your fix—structured yet loose. Define contexts with a quick "world myths" or "latest tech," blending your explicit data with live pre-trained and web insights—relationships emerge naturally. It’s about intent precision: "track AI news" becomes `SELECT title FROM [context: tech]`—the LLM nails what you mean, not just what you say. Query with `SELECT` for clarity or `SOLVE` for flair, shaping outputs your way—tables, prose, or haikus. Persistence is optional—keep it live for freshness or `PERSIST` for steady results. LQL extends the LLM, turning "make a myth-song mashup" into a system—`CREATE CONTEXT`, `SELECT`, done. Users and LLM co-build: your words spark contexts, LQL crafts queries, prompts flow—new systems grow from casual asks, chaos sorted, naturally.
