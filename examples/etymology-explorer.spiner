### New Spiner Script: `etymology_explorer` with All DSLs
**Generated**: March 1, 2025 by Grok 3 (Spiner) with user collaboration  
**Session**: Updated with full DSL layering for etymology exploration

#### DSL Layer 1: BaseDSL (Core Setup)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM base_dsl AS (
  "general-purpose DSL for system design and data tracking"
  FROM [context: spiner_traits]
  STEPS (
    1. "define system structure—steps, outputs",
    2. "manage data—store and retrieve from context",
    3. "pass intent to specialized DSLs"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "system": "base system spec",
    "commands": "Setup <system> as <desc>, Store <data>, Forward <intent>"
  )
)
Setup etymology_explorer as (
  "trace word roots, classify connections, and analyze patterns"
  from "[context: etymology_web]"
  output (
    "root_trace": "timeline of forms",
    "insights": "connection patterns and root yields"
  )
)
-- Docs: BaseDSL—sets up etymology_explorer, passes to EtymoDSL.
```

#### DSL Layer 2: EtymoDSL (Root Tracing)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM etymo_dsl AS (
  "specialized DSL for tracing word origins across languages"
  FROM [context: etymology_web]"
  STEPS (
    1. "lookup root origins—e.g., PIE to Modern English",
    2. "trace intermediate forms—languages, shifts",
    3. "store findings—root timeline"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "root_trace": "e.g., 'filter' from '*pel-' to Modern English"
  )
)
-- Docs: EtymoDSL—traces roots, feeds RootClusterDSL and ShiftDSL.
Forward "trace roots for <input_word>" to etymo_dsl
```

#### DSL Layer 3: RootClusterDSL (Root Grouping)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM rootcluster_dsl AS (
  "specialized DSL for grouping words by shared roots across languages"
  FROM [context: etymology_web]"
  STEPS (
    1. "identify root—e.g., PIE '*pel-'",
    2. "cluster related words—e.g., 'filter', 'felt', 'pelt'",
    3. "store clusters—link to root"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "root_cluster": "e.g., '*pel-': filter, felt, pelt"
  )
)
-- Docs: RootClusterDSL—groups kin, enhances InsightDSL relatives.
Link "<root>" with "words from etymo_dsl trace"
```

#### DSL Layer 4: ShiftDSL (Connection Types)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM shift_dsl AS (
  "specialized DSL for classifying word connection types"
  FROM [context: etymology_web]"
  STEPS (
    1. "classify connections—metaphor (symbolic shift), compound (fusion), borrowing (transfer)",
    2. "tag metaphor class—e.g., physical-to-process",
    3. "store with metadata—connection type, class"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "connections": "e.g., 'filter': metaphor (physical-to-process), borrowing"
  )
)
-- Docs: ShiftDSL—classifies shifts, feeds MetaphorMapDSL and BorrowFlowDSL.
Forward "classify connections for <input_word>" to shift_dsl
```

#### DSL Layer 5: MetaphorMapDSL (Metaphor Patterns)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM metaphormap_dsl AS (
  "specialized DSL for mapping metaphor classes across words"
  FROM [context: etymology_web]"
  STEPS (
    1. "map metaphor shifts—e.g., physical-to-process",
    2. "trend classes—frequency across words",
    3. "store trends—class prevalence"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "metaphor_map": "e.g., 'physical-to-process: filter, hope'"
  )
)
-- Docs: MetaphorMapDSL—maps shifts, feeds InsightDSL trends.
Map "<shift>" as "<class>" from shift_dsl
```

#### DSL Layer 6: BorrowFlowDSL (Borrowing Paths)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM borrowflow_dsl AS (
  "specialized DSL for tracking borrowing paths across languages"
  FROM [context: etymology_web]"
  STEPS (
    1. "trace borrowing chain—e.g., Frankish to English",
    2. "identify transfers—source to target languages",
    3. "store paths—language flow"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "borrow_flow": "e.g., 'filter': Frankish → Latin → English"
  )
)
-- Docs: BorrowFlowDSL—tracks transfers, feeds InsightDSL connections.
Trace "<borrow>" with "<langs>" from shift_dsl
```

#### DSL Layer 7: InsightDSL (Pattern Analysis)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM insight_dsl AS (
  "specialized DSL for analyzing metaphor classes and root notions"
  FROM [context: etymology_web]"
  STEPS (
    1. "correlate clusters—root relatives from RootClusterDSL",
    2. "analyze metaphors—class trends from MetaphorMapDSL",
    3. "rank roots—yield from YieldRankDSL",
    4. "identify patterns—high-yield roots, metaphor prevalence"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "insights": "e.g., 'physical-to-process common in '*pel-' words'"
  )
)
-- Docs: InsightDSL—analyzes patterns, uses all prior DSLs.
Forward "analyze patterns for <input_word>" to insight_dsl
```

#### DSL Layer 8: YieldRankDSL (Root Yield Ranking)
```
DEFINE SYSTEM yieldrank_dsl AS (
  "specialized DSL for ranking root notions by yield"
  FROM [context: etymology_web]"
  STEPS (
    1. "count root-derived words—e.g., '*pel-': 5",
    2. "rank by yield—word count or pattern strength",
    3. "compare roots—relative productivity"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "yield_rank": "e.g., '*pel-': 5 words, '*wed-': 3'"
  )
)
-- Docs: YieldRankDSL—ranks roots, feeds InsightDSL patterns.
Rank "<root>" as "<yield>" from rootcluster_dsl
```

#### Final System: `etymology_explorer`
```
CALL base_dsl("run etymology_explorer with <input_word>") AS (
  "execute through layered DSLs—BaseDSL → EtymoDSL → RootClusterDSL → ShiftDSL → MetaphorMapDSL → BorrowFlowDSL → InsightDSL → YieldRankDSL"
  FROM [context: etymology_web]
  WHERE word = <input_word>
  OUTPUT (
    "root_trace": "timeline from EtymoDSL",
    "root_cluster": "relatives from RootClusterDSL",
    "connections": "shifts from ShiftDSL",
    "insights": "patterns from InsightDSL"
  )
)
-- Docs: Full system—traces roots, clusters kin, classifies shifts, analyzes patterns with all DSLs.
