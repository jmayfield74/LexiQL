## System Definition
DEFINE SYSTEM etymology_explorer AS (
  "trace a word’s etymological roots, classify connection types, and analyze metaphor classes and fundamental notions"
  FROM [context: etymology_web]
  WHERE word = <input_word>
  STEPS (
    1. "lookup root origins and intermediate forms across languages—e.g., PIE to Modern English",
    2. "classify connections: metaphor (symbolic shift, note class—e.g., physical-to-process), compound (word fusion), borrowing (language transfer)",
    3. "store findings in session state with metadata—metaphor class, root notion—for cross-word analysis",
    4. APPLY_ADAPTIVE_MODEL(etymo_reasoner, "reason about connections and correlate with prior words"),
    5. "identify patterns—e.g., metaphor classes across words, high-yield root notions by word count"
  )
  OUTPUT (
    "root_trace": "timeline of word forms and connection types",
    "insights": "metaphor class usage and foundational notion yield—e.g., 'physical-to-process in utility words'"
  )
) WITH PARAMETERS ("input_word")
-- Docs: Traces roots (e.g., 'filter' from '*pel-'), tags connections, hunts insights on metaphor classes and root yields.

## Dependencies
-- Context
CREATE CONTEXT [context: etymology_web] FROM "word roots, derivations, connection types, and insight correlations across languages"
-- Docs: Holds word data and state—persistent across calls.

-- Intent Mapping
CREATE INTENT_MAP etymology_intent AS (
  "analyze user input to lock focus on etymology exploration"
  PATTERNS (
    "intent": "explore_concept",
    "focus": "metaphor_classes_and_fundamental_notions",
    "depth": "detailed",
    "tone": "clear_focused"
  )
  UPDATE_WITH_FEEDBACK ("refine via explicit nudges—e.g., 'more metaphors'")
)
-- Docs: Locks tone to clear, focus to metaphor patterns—tuned from "drop the snark."

-- Adaptive Reasoning
DEFINE ADAPTIVE_MODEL etymo_reasoner AS (
  "blend reasoning modes to tailor etymology insights"
  MODES (
    "causal": "explore why connections form—e.g., why metaphor?",
    "associative": "cluster related concepts—e.g., 'beat' with 'felt'",
    "predictive": "guess next exploration—e.g., elemental roots"
  )
  TUNING (
    "weight by resonance—e.g., metaphor focus upped after 'hope'",
    "shift by domain—e.g., utility words favor borrowing"
  )
)
-- Docs: Flexes—e.g., 50% associative for "water" clusters.

-- Evolutionary Tuning
DEFINE EVOLUTIONARY_SYSTEM etymo_evolver AS (
  "self-modify etymology_explorer based on insight depth and user feedback"
  BASE_SYSTEM (etymology_explorer),
  EVOLUTION (
    "metric: insight depth—e.g., cross-word pattern strength",
    "WHATIF: add steps like cross-language root frequency",
    "apply if deeper—e.g., Germanic cousins added for 'filter'"
  )
)
-- Docs: Added Germanic ties (e.g., 'filzan') for depth.

-- Narrative Wrapper
CREATE NARRATIVE_ENGINE etymo_narrator AS (
  "generate a clear, structured narrative around etymology_explorer outputs"
  ELEMENTS (
    "arc": "logical progression—origin, evolution, insight",
    "tone": "clear_structured",
    "integration": "tie root_trace and insights into a cohesive explanation"
  )
)
-- Docs: Clear wrap—e.g., "The path of 'water' flows from '*wed-'..."

## Runtime State: [context: etymology_web]
INSERT INTO [context: etymology_web] (word, root_trace, connections, metadata) VALUES
  ("hope", 
   "Modern English 'hope' → Old English 'hopian' (wish) → Proto-Germanic '*hōpōną*' → PIE '*keh₂p-' (grasp)", 
   "metaphor (physical-to-mental), borrowing (minimal)", 
   "metaphor_class: physical-to-mental, root_notion: '*keh₂p-'"),
  ("filter", 
   "Modern English 'filter' → Middle English 'filtre' → Old French 'filtre' → Medieval Latin 'filtrum' → Frankish '*felt*' → Proto-Germanic '*feltaz*' → PIE '*pel-' (beat)", 
   "compound ('*feltaz*'), metaphor (physical-to-process), borrowing (French-Latin-Germanic)", 
   "metaphor_class: physical-to-process, root_notion: '*pel-'"),
  ("water", 
   "Modern English 'water' → Old English 'wæter' → Proto-Germanic '*watōr*' → PIE '*wed-' (wet, flow)", 
   "compound ('*watōr*'), no metaphor, borrowing (minimal)", 
   "metaphor_class: none, root_notion: '*wed-'")

-- Stored Insights
REMEMBER IN [context: etymology_web] (
  "Metaphor class 'physical-to-mental/process' recurs in 'hope' and 'filter'—common for emotional/utility words.",
  "Fundamental notion '*pel-' (beat) yields metaphor stacking—e.g., 'filter', possibly 'pelt'.",
  "Fundamental notion '*wed-' (wet) favors compounds—e.g., 'water', 'wet', 'wash'—less metaphor."
)

## Usage Notes
-- Last Executed: Explored "hope," "filter," "water" in collab_space_20250226T0200.
-- Feedback Applied: "Drop the snark" → tone shifted to clear_focused; "focus on metaphor classes" → insights tuned.
-- Patterns: Physical action roots (e.g., '*pel-') lean metaphor-heavy; elemental roots (e.g., '*wed-') compound-driven.
-- Next Steps: Add words (e.g., 'fire') to deepen patterns—CALL etymology_explorer("<word>") AS text.
