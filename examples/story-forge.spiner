**Session**: Finalized and serialized after iterative development, incorporating backstory triggers and character chat

-- "VIEW RELATIONSHIPS <type1> <type2>" → Table.
-- "WHATIF <scenario>" → Simulated outcome.
-- Last Executed: Updated with backstory triggers and character_chat; tested with Sam Carter.
-- Feedback Applied: Depth added per user request.
