```

#### Usage Notes
```
-- Start: CALL story_forge("<your_seed>") AS interactive
-- Commands:
-- "Add character: <name>, <traits>, <actions>" → Builds profile.
-- "Simulate <character> vs. <event>" → Behavioral reaction.
-- "Suggest arcs" → Story/character arcs.
-- "Plan chapters" → Chapter outline.
-- "<character> does <action>" → Checks coherence, pushes back if off.
-- "EXPORT <synopsis/chapter> <num>" → Markdown blob.
-- "REPORT <entity_type> <name>" → Overview stats.
-- "LIST <entity_type>" → List (e.g., characters).
-- "VIEW RELATIONSHIPS <type1> <type2>" → Table.
-- "WHATIF <scenario>" → Simulated outcome.
-- Last Executed: Demo with "space colony" seed—added Mira/Zane, tested pushback.
-- Feedback Applied: Coherence enforced per user request.
